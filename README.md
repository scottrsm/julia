## Julia Projects

### Module Cards
Provides code to play a version of poker.

### Module Boolean
Provides ways to compare two boolean functions.
It uses an internal representation of boolean functions as bit-vectors and 
uses macros to provide a more intuitive external representation.

Module Wquantiles
A vew versions of weighted quantiles with examples
of using data parallelization.

### Jupyter Note Books

- BoolTest.ipynb  -- Jupyter notebook to test the Boolean module.
- CardTest.ipynb  -- Jupyter notebook to test the Cards module.
  - Comparisons of various poker hands is produced.
  - A poker game is simulated with two players.
- Wordle.ipynb    -- Jupyter notebook to test Wordle puzzle solver strategies.
- Wquantile.ipynb -- Jupyter notebook to test Wquantiles module.
                     In order to examine parallelism you must ensure
                     that your notebooks are running julia with multiple threads.
